    http {

            server {
                    listen       80;
                    server_name  localhost;

                    location / {
                            set $t1 yaoweibin;
                            set $t2 yaoweibin2;

                            rewrite (.*) /store last;

                            return 404;
                    }

                    location /store {
                            session_store zone=test $t1 $t2;

                            #store $t1, $t2 successfully, do whatever else;
                    }

                    location /get {
                            session_get zone=test $tt1 $tt2; 

                            #any handler with $tt1 and $tt2;
                    }
            }
    }

Description
    Add the support of session with Nginx, the session's lifetime is long
    than the request or connection.

Directives
  session_zone
    syntax: *session_zone $session_variable zone=name_of_zone:size*

    default: *none*

    context: *http*

    description: The directive describes the area, which stores the
    information with the sessions. The values of the session is determined
    by the given variable. Example of usage:

    session_zone $binary_remote_addr zone=test:10m;

    In this case, the session share memory zone is allocated 10MB as a zone
    called "test".

  session_store
    syntax: *session_store zone=name_of_zone [exprie=time_of_exprie]
    $variable1 [$variable2 ... $variable8]*

    default: *none*

    context: *location*

    description: Store the $variable1 to $variableN to the zone with the key
    of zone's session variable. The maximum number of variables is 8. Be
    careful, this directive executes before the 'set' and 'rewrite'
    directives.

    The expire is the timeout of the session. After the expired time, the
    session will be deleted. Default value is 60 seconds.

  session_get
    syntax: *session_get zone=name_of_zone $variable1 [$variable2 ...
    $variable8]*

    default: *none*

    context: *location*

    description: Get the $variable1 to $variableN from the zone with the key
    of zone's session variable. The maximum number of variables is 8. Be
    careful, this directive executes before the 'set' and 'rewrite'
    directives.
